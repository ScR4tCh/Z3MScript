Z3MScript
=========
Z3Mscript is a fork of a easy,very small and useful script interpreter (https://code.google.com/p/zemscript/).
It's relatively "featurless", but that is the point that makes it handy, due to the fact, that it is damn small and
easy to extend.

Thanks to Cameron Zemek for his work !

This fork adds some features such as "null pointer" to it.
